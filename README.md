### Introduction

Our "Taxi Demand Prediction" project seeks to give the user insights into the demand for taxis and the various fares at various times of the day. We plan to utilize a machine learning model to extract meaningful insights from various data collected from cab suppliers. Taxi companies would benefit from knowing when and where to increase the number and frequency of cabs with this model. The various fare prices at different times of the day would also be advantageous to taxi passengers.

### Steps to run the project:

1. Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohaibanwaar1203/taxi-demand-prediction/data
2. Download CPSC531-01_ADBMS_project.ipynb file and place the data and the code in the same folder.
3. Install findspark in Anaconda prompt
4. Run the cells in the jupyter notebook one by one and interpret the results.
   
   Note: While executing the conversion of spark dataframe to csv file, please change the file path which you want to store in your directory. Also, change the  directory to take  the  csv  files from.
